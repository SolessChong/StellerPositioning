Overview

This is a project for my astronomy course.
It contains several utilities for astrometry. The original goal of this project was to build an automatic system that can ecognize the bright stars in the night sky by CV approaches.

Modules
=======

A camera projection utility

Basic star coordinate convertion utility, Cartesian to J2000

3rd Parties
===========

EmguCV
LumenWorks CSV Reader @ Codeproject.com
HYG star catalog @ github.com


How to use it?
==============

It is not a complete project, not all the features are available in the UI.
For a brief demo, just run the program and pull the scrollbar to navigate among the stars.
